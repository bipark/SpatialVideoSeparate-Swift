# Spatial Video Separate - Swift/SwiftUI

Separating right and left images in spatial video

## Introduction

Spatial Video is a 3D video supported by the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. If you have an iPhone 15 Pro or a Max, you can create Spatial Video. However, this video can only be played on Apple Vision Pro and Oculus.

The basic principle of Spatial Video is a method that utilizes the difference in vision between both eyes, so you can watch 3D videos in a regular video player by using 3D glasses that you are already using.

In this project, I implement the basic functionality to separate the left-eye image and the right-eye image in Spatial Video, providing the basic functionality to utilize the images.


## App
